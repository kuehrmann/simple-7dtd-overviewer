======================

A simple map overviewer for the game 7 Days to Die

How to use?
===========

This small python script generates an HTML website of the PNG images the 7DTD dedicated server generates. Simply put it in the directory "map" inside your saved world directory. Then execute it by typing "python generate.py". Afterwards there is an "index.html" file which has a table referencing the PNG in its cells. At the top there are links to different zoom levels, which refer to 4 higher zoom level "indexZ.html" (where Z stands for the zoom level).
